## History

Network automation has focused so far on automating "actions". As an Industry, we have focused on the "how" and get it automated (how to automate a software upgrade, how to automate a configuration change, how to automate service provisioning, etc.).

## Why to read this Book ?

We are about to enter a new Era in managing our network and cloud infrastructures, one where we will need to automate "decisions". It is about automating the answers for the other remaining questions: the when, the what, the why, and the where.

Network and Cloud infrastructures are more complex than ever but more critical than ever. This book is the perfect storm for network and cloud engineers.

## Synopsis

**Machine Learning for Network and Cloud Engineers** by **Javier Antich** is a practical guide for network and cloud engineers looking to leverage machine learning in their work. 

The book covers a wide range of machine learning techniques and algorithms, from traditional statistical methods to cutting-edge deep neural networks. It provides real-world examples and use cases for applying these techniques in network and cloud infrastructures, along with Python code to help readers get started. 

The book aims to equip engineers with the knowledge and skills needed to automate decisions and optimize their networks and clouds using machine learning.
